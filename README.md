## News <a name="news"></a>
  - [2025/02/18] In our latest work [DriveTransformer (ICLR25)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=M42KR4W9P5), **a tiny validation set [Dev10](./leaderboard/data/drivetransformer_bench2drive_dev10.xml) is proposed for quick development of models.** The 10 clips are carefully selected from the official 220 routes, to be both difficult and representative with low variance.  It is suggested to be used for ablation study to avoid overfitting the whole bench2drive220 routes.
  - [2025/02/05] As meticulously described in [CARLA_GARGE](https://github.com/autonomousvision/carla_garage/blob/leaderboard_2/docs/common_mistakes_in_benchmarking_ad.md), L2 error is not a meaningful indictor at all. We agree that **authors' should stop reporting results on nuScenes open-loop planning and reviewers should not ask for nuScenes open-loop planning results**. The number on nuScenes open-loop planning is not persuasive at all and could only lead to unjustified and wrong conclusions, which may impede the development of the field.  As a member of the community, we call for stopping using nuScenes open-loop planning as well.
  - [2024/10/14] As kindly pointed out in an [issue](https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/Bench2Drive/issues/112), typos were discovered in the ability calculation. We have corrected the typos and updated the multi-ability results. This update will **not affect driving score and success rate**. 
  - [2024/10/14] As kindly pointed out in an [issue](https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/Bench2DriveZoo/issues/46), a bug was discovered in the B2D_vad_dataset. We leave it here to be consistent with existing results. We do not anticipate any major influence caused by this bug. Users may fix the bug according to their needs.
  - [2024/09/26] Bench2Drive is accepted at NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track.
  - [2024/08/27] We update the latest results under the new protocols with **two new metrics and fixed bugs**. 
  - [2024/08/19] **[Major Updates]** To better assess driving performance, we add two additional metrics: Driving Efficiency and Driving Smoothness. Consequently, we remove the penalty for minimum speed in calculating the Drive Score and extend the TickRunTime from 2000 to 4000 to allow for a more lenient driving evaluation. We are currently reassessing all baselines.
  - [2024/08/10] We update the team_code agent of UniAD and VAD to fix the camera projection bug mentioned in 2024/07/29. Their corresponding scores will be uploaded soon with new metrics introduced.
  - [2024/07/29] As kindly suggested in an [issue](https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/Bench2Drive/issues/36), there is a bug in the team code agent of UniAD and VAD during evaluation, i.e, **the BACK CAMERA's extrinsic is wrong**. The training process is correct. To be consistent with the reported results, we do not modify the code right now. Users' are strongly encouraged to use the correct extrinsics.
  - [2024/07/22] We add more reminders in the evaluation code to avoid the miss of logs. According to [Haochen](https://github.com/georgeliu233)'s kind suggestion, we add automatic cleaning code in the evaluation toolkit. Users' may set in their bash script to restart the evaluation infinitely until finishing the evaluation since CARLA is easy to crash.
  - [2024/07/10] We further clean and add more clips in the Full set (13638 clips). Since HuggingFace only allows up to 10000 files per repo, we use two repos to store the Full set. As suggested in this issue [issue](https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/Bench2Drive/issues/17), we add a filelist and sha256 of clips for each set.
  - [2024/06/19] Due to a typo in the upload script for HuggingFace, all clips of scenario VehicleTurningRoutePedestrian are empty in the HuggingFace version. We have fixed that. Please check your data to make sure they are not empty. 
  - [2024/06/05] Bench2Drive realases the Full dataset (10000 clips), evaluation tools, baseline code, and benchmark results.
  - [2024/04/27] Bench2Drive releases the Mini (10 clips) and Base (1000 clips) split of the official training data.

## Dataset <a name="dataset"></a>
  - The datasets has 3 subsets, collected by **our strong world model based RL expert [Think2Drive](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16720)**, namely Mini (10 clips), Base (1000 clips) and Full (10000 clips), to accommodate different levels of computational resource.
  - [Detailed explanation](docs/anno.md) of dataset structure, annotation information, and visualization of data.

## Student Model Code (with Think2Drive as Teacher Model)
  - [Uniad/VAD](https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/Bench2DriveZoo/tree/uniad/vad) in Bench2Drive
  - [TCP/ADMLP](https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/Bench2DriveZoo/tree/tcp/admlp) in Bench2Drive
## Setup
  - Download and setup CARLA 0.9.15
    ```bash
        mkdir carla
        cd carla
        wget https://carla-releases.s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com/Linux/CARLA_0.9.15.tar.gz
        tar -xvf CARLA_0.9.15.tar.gz
        cd Import && wget https://carla-releases.s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com/Linux/AdditionalMaps_0.9.15.tar.gz
        cd .. && bash ImportAssets.sh
        export CARLA_ROOT=YOUR_CARLA_PATH
        echo "$CARLA_ROOT/PythonAPI/carla/dist/carla-0.9.15-py3.7-linux-x86_64.egg" >> YOUR_CONDA_PATH/envs/YOUR_CONDA_ENV_NAME/lib/python3.7/site-packages/carla.pth # python 3.8 also works well, please set YOUR_CONDA_PATH and YOUR_CONDA_ENV_NAME
    ```

## Eval Tools
  - Add your agent to leaderboard/team_code/your_agent.py & Link your model folder under the Bench2Drive directory.
    ```bash
        Bench2Drive\ 
          assets\
          docs\
          leaderboard\
            team_code\
              --> Please add your agent HEAR
          scenario_runner\
          tools\
          --> Please link your model folder HEAR
    ```
  - Debug Mode
    ```bash
        # Verify the correctness of the team agentï¼Œ need to set GPU_RANK, TEAM_AGENT, TEAM_CONFIG
        bash leaderboard/scripts/run_evaluation_debug.sh
    ```
  - Multi-Process Multi-GPU Parallel Eval. If your team_agent saves any image for debugging, it might take lots of disk space.
    ```bash
        # Please set TASK_NUM, GPU_RANK_LIST, TASK_LIST, TEAM_AGENT, TEAM_CONFIG, recommend GPU: Task(1:2).
        # It is normal that certain model can not finsih certain routes, no matter how many times we restart the evaluation. It should be treated as failing as it usually happens in the routes where agents behave badly.
        bash leaderboard/scripts/run_evaluation_multi_uniad.sh
    ```
  - Visualization - make a video for debugging with canbus info printed on the sequential images.
    ```bash
        python tools/generate_video.py -f your_rgb_folder/
    ```
  - Metric: **Make sure there are exactly 220 routes in your json. Failed/Crashed status is also acceptable. Otherwise, the metric is inaccurate.**
    ```bash
        # Merge eval json and get driving score and success rate
        # This script will assume the total number of routes with results is 220. If there is not enough, the missed ones will be treated as 0 score.
        python tools/merge_route_json.py -f your_json_folder/

        # Get multi-ability results
        python tools/ability_benchmark.py -r merge.json

        # Get driving efficiency and driving smoothness results
        python tools/efficiency_smoothness_benchmark.py -f merge.json -m your_metric_folder/
    ```
## Deal with CARLA

- CARLA has complex dependencies and is not stable. Please check the issue section of CARLA **very carefully**.
- Use tools/clean_carla.sh frequently and multiple times. Some CARLA processes are difficult to kill. Be sure to clean_carla could avoid lots of bugs.
- In our evaluation tools, the launch of CARLA is automatic: https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/Bench2Drive/tree/main/leaderboard/leaderboard/leaderboard_evaluator.py#L203. But you could always start CARLA by the one single command line to debug.
- CARLA is not controlled CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES! It is controlled by -graphicsadapter in the command line. **Interestingly, in some machines, for some unknown reasons, -graphicsadapter=1 is not available.** For example, with 4 GPUS, it might be: GPU0 -graphicsadapter=0, GPU1  -graphicsadapter=2, GPU2 -graphicsadapter=3, GPU3  -graphicsadapter=4.
- The conflict of PORT is frequently happened. Use lsof-i:YOUR_PORT frequently to avoid conflict. Avoid use small port numbers (<10000 could be unsafe).
- *4.26.2-0+++UE4+Release-4.26 522 0 Disabling core dumps*. Only showing these two lines without termination is good. *WARNING: lavapipe is not a conformant vulkan implementation, testing use only.* is bad.
- **If you face issues, always try to start CARLA in one single line to make sure CARLA could run.** If CARLA is finished immediately, it is very possible to be related to Vulkan. *Try /usr/bin/vulkaninfo | head -n 5*
- Re-install vulkan might be helpful *sudo apt install vulkan-tools; sudo apt install vulkan-utils*  In the end, you need to make sure your vulkan is correct. We have tested *Vulkan Instance Version: 1.x WARNING: lavapipe is not a conformant vulkan implementation, testing use only.* and version 1.1/1.2/1.3 works fine.
- We find that nvidia driver version 470 is good all the time. 515 has some problems but okay. 550 has lots of bugs.
- *sleep* is important to avoid crash of CARLA. For example, https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/Bench2Drive/blob/main/leaderboard/leaderboard/leaderboard_evaluator.py#L207, the sleep time should be extended for slower machines. When it comes to multi-gpu evaluation, https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/Bench2Drive/blob/main/leaderboard/scripts/run_evaluation_multi_uniad.sh#L58, the sleep time should also be extended for slower machines.
